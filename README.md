## This project is a demonstration. It uses a Support Vector Classification (SVC) and a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to recognize a face. The process of the code is in the notebook name face_recognition.ipynb (./notebooks/face_recognition.ipynb)

## The accuracy of the model is around *75%* (The model uses small resolution image)
